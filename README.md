I wanted to experiment with [json-schema](http://json-schema.org/) but couldn't find anything online. Frustrated, I built this poor excuse for application in 7 minutes while eating a longhorn beef flatbread sandwich.

Many thanks to [ace](http://ace.ajax.org) for the editor and [JSV](https://github.com/garycourt/JSV) for the json-schema validator.

# Instructions

Schema goes in the left. Data in the right. Any errors appear at the bottom.
